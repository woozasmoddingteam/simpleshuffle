This mod replaces Shine's algorithm for shuffling with hive skill.

The algorithm basically iterates over all players from best to worst in pairs of two,
and then distributes the pair over each team as appropriate.

This ensures that a highly skilled player will not have to carry a team full of rookies,
but that instead the teams will be somewhat more homogenous in ability.

Of course this does not produce as balanced teams as the vanilla Shine shuffle, but it
produces more **fun** teams. No one wants to carry the entire burden.
